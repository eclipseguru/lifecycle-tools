This directory contains the source for the lifecycle top-level project charter
in AsciiDoc format, the build script, and generated output.

Note that the build script is configured to generate output for a specific version
of the document and running the build may overwrite an existing document.

The output files (*.html) may be live documents that may be included by the
other documents found in the repository, so take care with what you commit.
